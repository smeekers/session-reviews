# TODO List

- [ ] Put more thought into UI (design). Theme and the ui library will help make this easy to change wholesale
- [ ] lean heavier into theme
- [ ] error page, session ended page (direct to details or whiteboard)
- [ ] draggable video panel
- [ ] we should not be fetching all sessions at once, add pagination
- [ ] audio indicator in session
- [ ] Get recordings properly working
- [ ] s3 integration for recordings
- [ ] Use Dynamo table
- [ ] Use ok response and event listeners for long BE processes (eg end session) pusher? something better?
- [ ] Actual AI interaction (need to craft prompt and turn prompt into json. Reject and retry logic)
- [ ] We need more filters and a sort option
- [ ] Consider the actual value of the UI library as opposed to just using MUI directly. These can mostly be handled via theme overrides
- [ ] add yjs names when sharing
- [ ] users? Would unlock auth tokens for liveblocks
- [ ] update typography (use theme)
- [ ] error boundary
- [ ] error consistency
- [ ] user facing error handling
- [ ] code splitting for performance (at least lazy loading)
